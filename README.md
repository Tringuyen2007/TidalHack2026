Pipely is an AI-powered platform that aligns multi-year inline inspection (ILI) data to track corrosion growth and detect defects early. It uses self-supervised ML (XGBoost, DBSCAN, Bayesian regression) to match anomalies across inspection runs despite data drift, delivering engineer-ready insights through an interactive React dashboard.
